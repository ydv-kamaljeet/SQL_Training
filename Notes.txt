SQL NOTES 

General Best Practices:

Never use * with SELECT queries in real applications. (reduce performance)
Always use column aliases for better readability.
Use table aliases to simplify queries and avoid ambiguity.


Commenting in SQL Server : 
-- is used for single-line comments.

Shortcut to comment selected lines: Ctrl + K, Ctrl + C
Shortcut to uncomment selected lines: Ctrl + K, Ctrl + U

SSMS Output Shortcuts
Ctrl + D → Results in Grid (Table format)
Ctrl + T → Results in Text format
Ctrl + R → Show/Hide the Results panel
Alt + f1 -> complete detail about table. If this doesn't work , do this  => sp_help '[Person].[EmailAddress]' 

CROSS JOIN Concept
CROSS JOIN creates a Cartesian Product.
Each row from one table combines with every row of another table.
Should be used carefully due to performance impact.

DUAL Table (Conceptual Note)
The DUAL table is an Oracle-specific dummy table.
Used when a query requires a FROM clause but no actual table data is needed.
Commonly used to evaluate expressions or call functions.

Operators Meaning
= → Equal to
<> → Not equal to
NOT → Negation
IN → Multiple values comparison
BETWEEN → Range-based filtering

Stored Procedure syntax:
alter procedure myPractice
--optional or parameters
@OrderId int 
as begin
select * from Orders where OrderId = @OrderId
end;


go -- Go sepearates the queries 
exec myPractice 5001
